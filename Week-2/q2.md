# Question 2
<p>
  Although searching through a hash table only requires a time complexity of O(1), a large organization might have a very big database and hash tables are generally <b>less memory-efficient</b> because its size is not necessarily equal to the amount of data stored inside, whereas for trees, they only store what has to be stored. 
<br><br>
  Keys in trees can be easily sorted by traversing through the nodes, but in hash tables, the items are stored based on their keys or values. There is no particular order about them and hence makes them harder to sort. In a databse system, you might want to make a query that requires sorting and trees seem to be a better fit than hash tables.
<br><br>
  Trees are easier to implement than hash tables with more customizations.
 <br><br>
  All operations in trees are known to have a time complexity of O(logn), whereas for hash tables, O(1) time is just an average and might not be the same for other operatios, such as resizing a hash table.
